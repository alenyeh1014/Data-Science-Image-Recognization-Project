# Ship Image Recognizations 
Hi all, this is a Data Science Project ! - Image Recognizations with CNN Deep Learning Methodology.


### Project Objective

* The purpose of this project is to apply Deep Learning Methodology for Image Recognizations in order to detect the real ships over the ocean.


### Methods Used

* Inferential Statistics
* Data Wrangling
* Deep Learning
* Predictive Modeling


### Algorithm Used

- Deeping Learning:

  - Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
  
  
### Technologies and Packaged Used

* Python, Jupyter Notebook
* Numpy, Pandas, Glob
* Tensorflow, Keras, Cv2


### Project Description

* Motivation:

  - There are tons of ships navigating all over the ocean every day, but only few can be detected by satellite or other means quickly and accurately. Certain routes may be of interest for regulating environmental disruption, monitoring ships at risk of piracy, and avoiding overcrowding.
  
  
* Data and Scope:

  - I used segments of satellite imagery submitted to the public by Airbus for use in a Kaggle classification competition. This dataset contains a database of more than 200,000 small images of tankers, commercial ships, or fishing ships. 
  
  
* Methodology Approach:

  - Convolutional layers apply a convolution operation to the input, passing the result to the next layer. The convolution emulates the response of an individual neuron to visual stimuli. Each neuron processes data only for itsÂ receptive field.

  
 * Conclusion:
 
  - The test accuracy is more than 65% which is good. This model can be applied to satellite images from any area of interest for ship detection and quantification.
